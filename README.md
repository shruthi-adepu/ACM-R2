# ACM R2
Hi, I am Shruthi Adepu. I am enrolled in Msc-Bio course here in BITS Pilani and I am looking to broaden my scope by joining ACM. I have no prior coding experience, as I did not have the option of taking computer as a subject where I come from. I have explored all the verticals and I decided that I would like to pursue the "Artifical Intelligence" vertical. It is quite obvious that AI has been the industry buzzword for the past decade, but honestly the premise of AI and the things that are capable with AI really got me interested. My interest was especially piqued this year when I saw the AI Art Revolution (wombo, dall-e, etc) and the recent arrival of chatgpt. I understand that these fall into a category called "Deep learning", although since I had no prior programming experience, I focused my 10 days on learning python instead of going for AI specific tasks. I am definitely curious and motivated to explore the same going forward.

# What I did
I followed along with the kaggle mini-course on python, at https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python
I also did https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-programming but I was not aware of github back then, so unfortunately I did not save any of the files I wrote during that time (I used an online compiler)

All the jupyter notebooks I wrote during the python course are present in the repo

# What I want to do
Going forward, I feel like I have a good basic understanding of python. I would now like to explore various libraries specific to ML. I have read that I need to be thorough with numpy and pandas (and to some extent matplotlib) so I will start with those. Unfortunately with quizzes and midsems coming up, I feel progress will be slow, although I am definitely excited to continue my learning journey.
